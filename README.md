# OvernightTracking

Tracking non-human primate movements through a 24-hour period using an XBox one Kinect. Both Python and MATLAB versions are included, but the project mainly used the Python scripts. 

Movements were collected via changes in depth using the IR camera. The main body of the animal was found within the frame using opencv and the movement metric calculated and saved in real time.
